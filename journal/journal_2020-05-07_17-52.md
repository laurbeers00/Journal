For our final project my group has decided that we will split up so that half of us will focus on the TEI file while the other half wil focus on the timeline. I have expressed my interest in attempting the timeline due to the difficulties I have with reading the handwriting as well as matching up versions. 
We have decided that we will be analyzing page 50 of version F, which is a slight change from our initial plan of also doing another page.
Today I commented on a Thoreau passage in an ending chapter that reminded me how nice change is after we have put ourselves in a strict routine.
