For the final project, my group has chosen to take a closer look at the revisions of version E p.55-56 and version f p.50. These pages are what would become "The Ponds" in Walden. We are looking to see to what extent Thoreau pays attention to detail. In addition to this we will attempt to see how Thoreau uses precise language so that the reader can truly understad what he is attempting to say.

We have begun working on a timeline.
